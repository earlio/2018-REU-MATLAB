function [age_dist_m] = create_age_dist_m(number_generations, population_0, leslie_matrix,burn_in_gens)
%Inputs: 
%1. number_generations - The preset number of generations that we are testing the data on
%2. population_0 - a vector with the initial population of individuals for
%each age class
%3. leslie_matrix - a leslie matrix corresponding to the input life table,
%generated using the life_to_leslie function
%4. burn-in-gens - the number of generations required for the population to
%stabilize

% This function generates a burn-in matrix to allow the population to
% stabilize, and an age distribution matrix which contains the distribution
% of individuals among the age classes over the preset number of
% generations. The age distribution matrix begins with the final column of
% the burn-in matrix. This function also displays warnings if the
% population size of an age class grows too large, and a warning of when
% the population stabilizes to ensure the number of burn-in generations is
% correctly set. 


%Outputs:
%1. age_dist_m - The only output is the demographic matrix/age distribution matrix
