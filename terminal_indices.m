function [indices] = terminal_indices(lineage_count, age_dist_m, age)
%Inputs:
%1. lineage_count - the preset number of lineages that the user wants to
%sample
%2. age_dist_m - the age distribution/demographic matrix containing the
%population of each age class over the number of generations
%3. age - should be -1 if #lineage_count random individuals are to be
%selected, or a given age >= 0 if #lineage_count individuals from that
%specific age class are to be sampled. 

%This function randomly selects indices in the final generation of the
%demographic matrix to begin the lineage trace. If the age input is -1 it
%randomly selects #lineage_count individuals randomly (without
%replacement). If the age input is 0 or higher it randomly selects
%individuals from that given age class

%Outputs:
%1. indices - indices is a 2xlineage_count matrix which contains both the
%index of each selected individual and its age. The first row contains the
%indices and the second row contains the ages.
