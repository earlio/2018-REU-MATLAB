function [life_table_m,leslie_matrix,ages,orig_lambda,mod_lambda,CV_fecundity,G,alpha, AL] = life_to_leslie_4(file_path_name,scale)

    % A function to input a life table and produce a Leslie matrix that can be used to simulate population demography over time. 

    % This function requires a life table in a .csv or an .xlsx file in the form of an number of ages x 3 matrix. 
    % Column 1 contains the ages as integers, Column 2 contains age-specific survival as a real number, Column 3 contains age-specific fecundity as a real number. 
    % The oldest age class in the life table should always have zero probability of
    % survival, although the age-specific fecundity need not be zero. 
    % Life tables should NOT include a final age class where both survival and fecundity are zero.
    %
    % An example life table file would contain:

    %     Example life table in .xlsx file (row with title string...)		
    %     Age	Sx	Bx (row with column headings)
    %     1	0.9	0.000
    %     2	0.6	0.429
    %     3	0.4	0.310
    %     4	0.0	0.120

    % Inputs:
    %
    % file_path_name - path name to life table file
    % scale - scalar rela number that is used to rescale the population
    % growth rate. To achieve a population growth rate of one, all elements of the Leslie matrix are divided by the leading eigenvalue.
    % If the leading eigenvalue is multiplied by a scale value, the growth
    % rate can be altered to be more or less than one and the rate of
    % growth or shrinkage altered.
    % when scale = 1.0 - population growth rate of exactly 1.0
    % when scale > 1.0 - negative population growth rate
    % when scale < 1.0 - positive population growth rate
    
    % Outputs:
    % life_table_m - the numeric values of the life table, an ages x three matrix of real numbers
    % leslie_matrix - corresponding Leslie Matrix that is square ages x ages,
    %	rescaled to constant population size over time if rescale = true.
    % ages - integer number of age classes in life table
    % orig_lambda - real number pop growth rate of original life table
    % mod_lambda - real number pop growth rate after rescaling
    % CV_fecundity - scalar real number coefficient of variance in age-specific
    %   fecundity
    % G - scalar real number generation length, G, or mean age of a parent
    % alpha - scalar real number age when bx first > zero
    % AL - integer adult lifespan

    % knowledge of file type, works for Excel and for .csv
